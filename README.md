Please keep the following guidelines when working with the repo:

- Create a new sub-folder for every presentation
- Naming convention for folder and presentation: YYYY_MM_topic_short

Everytime you push to the main branch, the website is re-rendered. Have a look at
`index.qmd` to see how you can link your own presentation on the website.
