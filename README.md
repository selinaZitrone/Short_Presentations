Please keep the following guidelines when working with the repo:

- Create a new sub-folder for every presentation
- Naming convention for folder and presenation: YYYY_MM_topic_short

In `Quarto_demo` you can find a demo presentation that shows different quarto 
features you can use in your presentations. But of course you don't have to use quarto
if you don't want to.
